# 4G Proxy Server - System Architecture

## Overview

This is a full-stack 4G proxy server application built with React (TypeScript) on the frontend and Express.js on the backend. The system manages multiple 4G modems, provides proxy services, handles IP rotation, and offers OpenVPN configuration generation. It features a modern dashboard interface with real-time monitoring capabilities and WebSocket communication.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket client for live updates

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for broadcasting updates
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Proxy Backend**: 3proxy software for HTTP and SOCKS5 proxy services
- **Proxy Management**: Automated 3proxy configuration generation and service management

## Key Components

### Data Layer
- **Database Schema**: Located in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Tables**: users, modems, vpnConnections, ipRotationLogs, systemLogs, proxyConfiguration, analytics
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **Migrations**: Managed through drizzle-kit (`npm run db:push`)
- **Storage**: DatabaseStorage class replaced MemStorage for persistent data

### API Layer
- **REST Endpoints**: Express routes for CRUD operations
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication for live updates
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory fallback
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with stats, modem status, and activity logs
- **Modems Management**: View and control 4G modems
- **IP Rotation**: Manual and automated IP rotation controls
- **OpenVPN**: VPN configuration generation and management
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and performance metrics
- **Configuration**: System and proxy settings
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API endpoint testing

### UI/UX Design
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Theme**: "New York" style with neutral base colors
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with breakpoint utilities
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons throughout the interface

## Data Flow

### Real-time Updates
1. Backend WebSocket server broadcasts system changes
2. Frontend WebSocket client receives updates
3. React Query cache invalidation triggers UI updates
4. Components re-render with fresh data

### API Communication
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests via TanStack Query
2. Express routes handle requests and interact with storage
3. Drizzle ORM manages database operations
4. Responses are cached and managed by React Query

### State Management
1. Server state managed by TanStack Query
2. Local component state managed by React hooks
3. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
4. Form state handled by React Hook Form with Zod validation

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **Connection**: Via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Migrations**: Automated through drizzle-kit

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Fast development experience

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Class Variance Authority**: Component variant management
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `/dist/public`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `/dist`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push`

### Production Setup
- **Start Command**: `npm start` runs the built Express server
- **Static Files**: Express serves built React app
- **Database**: Connects to production PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=production for optimizations

### Development Workflow
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` runs both frontend and backend
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for instant frontend updates
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript checking across entire stack
- **Database**: Development database via DATABASE_URL
